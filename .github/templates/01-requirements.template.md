| Current State | {Greenfield / Migration / Modernization / Extension} |
| Migration Source | {On-prem, other cloud, legacy platform — or N/A if greenfield} |
| Business Drivers | {Why this project? Cost savings, growth, compliance, etc.} |
| Success Criteria | {How will business success be measured?} |
