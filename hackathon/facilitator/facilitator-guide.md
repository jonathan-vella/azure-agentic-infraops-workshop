# Facilitator Guide

> **For hackathon coaches and facilitators only.**

## Event Overview

| Aspect       | Details                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Duration     | 6 hours                               |
| Participants | 20-24                                 |
| Teams        | 5-6 (3-4 members each)                |
| Format       | Challenge-based, full 7-step workflow |
| Skill Level  | Azure portal familiar, new to IaC     |

## Your Role

1. **Guide, don't solve** — Help teams find answers, don't write their code
2. **Monitor progress** — Check in with each team every 15-20 minutes
3. **Unblock quickly** — Don't let teams stall for more than 5 minutes on setup issues
4. **Encourage experimentation** — There's no single "correct" architecture
5. **Celebrate learning** — The goal is understanding, not perfection

---

## Coaching Philosophy

**Answer questions with questions.** Your goal is to help teams develop problem-solving skills, not
to provide direct solutions.

### Coaching Phrases to Use

| Situation                    | Say This                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Team asks how to fix error   | "What does the error message tell you?"         |
| Team asks for solution       | "What have you tried so far?"                   |
| Team stuck on agent prompt   | "How would you prompt the agent to solve this?" |
| Team unsure about decision   | "What business requirement drives this?"        |
| Team asks "Should we use X?" | "What would you try? What are the tradeoffs?"   |

### When to Provide Direct Help

Only intervene directly when:

- **Environment issues** (authentication, tool failures)
- **Time-critical blocks** (team stalled >5 minutes on setup)
- **Factual information** ("Which region supports zone redundancy?")

**Remember**: Struggle leads to learning. Let teams work through challenges with guidance, not
solutions.

## Pre-Event Setup

### Governance Policies (Optional but Recommended)

Deploy Azure Policies to create realistic governance constraints. Teams will encounter real policy errors!

```powershell
# Check current governance status
.\scripts\hackathon\Get-GovernanceStatus.ps1 -SubscriptionId "<sub-id>"

# Deploy hackathon policies (checks for existing before creating)
.\scripts\hackathon\Setup-GovernancePolicies.ps1 -SubscriptionId "<sub-id>"

# After event: Remove policies
.\scripts\hackathon\Remove-GovernancePolicies.ps1 -SubscriptionId "<sub-id>"
```

**Policies deployed:**

| Policy                  | Effect | Forces                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Allowed locations       | Deny   | Only `swedencentral`, `germanywestcentral` |
| Require Environment tag | Deny   | Must tag all resources                     |
| Require Project tag     | Deny   | Must tag all resources                     |
| SQL Azure AD-only auth  | Deny   | No SQL passwords                           |
| Storage HTTPS only      | Deny   | `supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true`           |
| Storage min TLS 1.2     | Deny   | `minimumTlsVersion: 'TLS1_2'`              |
| Storage no public blob  | Deny   | `allowBlobPublicAccess: false`             |
| App Service HTTPS       | Deny   | `httpsOnly: true`                          |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Policies take 5-15 minutes to become effective after deployment.
