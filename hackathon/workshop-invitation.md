# Agentic InfraOps Workshop — Invitation

> **Transform how you deliver Azure infrastructure using AI-powered agents**

---

## What Is This?

A **5-hour hands-on hackathon** where you'll experience the future of Infrastructure as Code.

Forget writing Bicep templates line by line. In this workshop, you'll orchestrate **specialized
AI agents** that collaborate to transform business requirements into production-ready Azure
infrastructure — complete with:

- 🏗️ **Azure Verified Modules** — Enterprise-grade, Microsoft-maintained Bicep modules
- 📊 **Well-Architected Assessments** — AI-guided evaluation across all five WAF pillars
- 📐 **Diagrams as Code** — Auto-generated architecture visuals from your infrastructure
- 📝 **Qualitative Documentation** — Professional artifacts ready for customer delivery
- 💰 **Real-Time Cost Estimates** — Pricing insights powered by Azure MCP integration

**The scenario**: Design and deploy cloud infrastructure for _Nordic Fresh Foods_, a growing
farm-to-table delivery company that needs a modern platform before peak season.

## The Challenge Flow

```
Requirements → Architecture → Bicep Code → ⚡DR Curveball⚡ → Load Test → Partner Showcase
```

Work in teams of 3-4 to complete six challenges. A surprise "curveball" midway tests your
ability to adapt to changing requirements — just like real projects!

## What Makes This Different?

This isn't a traditional workshop where you follow step-by-step instructions.
You'll **collaborate with AI agents** that understand Azure best practices,
making decisions together and learning why certain patterns work.

By the end, you'll have:

- ✅ Deployed real Azure infrastructure
- ✅ Generated production-ready Bicep templates
- ✅ Practiced customer-facing presentation skills
- ✅ Experienced the "agentic" approach to cloud engineering
