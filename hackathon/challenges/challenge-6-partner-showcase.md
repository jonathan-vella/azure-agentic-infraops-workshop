# Challenge 6: Partner Showcase 🎤

> **Duration**: 40 minutes | **Format**: Role-Play Presentations | **Points**: Not Scored (Soft Skills)

## Overview

This is your moment to shine! Each team will present their FreshConnect solution to a "customer"
(played by another team) while Microsoft facilitators observe and provide feedback.

**This challenge simulates a real partner-customer engagement** — the kind you'll experience
when delivering Azure solutions professionally.

## Customer Role: Question Bank

**If you're playing the customer**, use these questions to challenge the partner team.
Pick 2-3 questions that are relevant to their presentation.

### Architecture Questions

| Question                                                 | What You're Testing                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "Why did you choose [Service A] over [Service B]?"       | Can they justify technical decisions? |
| "How does this scale when we triple our order volume?"   | Did they think about peak season?     |
| "What happens if the primary region goes down?"          | Do they understand DR?                |
| "We might expand to Norway next year. How hard is that?" | Is the architecture extensible?       |

### Security Questions

| Question                                      | What You're Testing     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |

| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "This looks expensive. Can we cut costs anywhere?" | Cost optimization awareness    |
| "What happens to the bill during peak season?"     | Understanding of scaling costs |
| "Are there any hidden costs we should know about?" | Transparency                   |
| "What if we need to add more features later?"      | Future cost implications       |

### Operational Questions

| Question                                          | What You're Testing   |

## Tips for Presenters (Partner Role)

✅ **DO:**

- Be confident — you built something real!
- Admit what you didn't finish (honesty wins respect)
- Explain trade-offs, not just decisions
- Use your artifacts (diagrams, Bicep, cost estimates)
- Thank the customer for their questions

❌ **DON'T:**

- Read from slides word-for-word
- Get defensive about questions
- Blame tools or time constraints
- Oversell features you didn't implement
- Go over time (the facilitator will cut you off!)

---

## Tips for Questioners (Customer Role)

✅ **DO:**

- Ask genuine questions (you might learn something!)
- Challenge assumptions respectfully
- Focus on business outcomes, not just tech
- Pick questions relevant to their presentation

❌ **DON'T:**

- Be hostile or try to "catch" them
- Ask questions just to show off
- Interrupt the presentation
- Ask about things clearly out of scope

---

## Microsoft Feedback Focus

Facilitators will provide brief feedback on:

| Area                | What We'll Comment On                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity**         | Was the solution easy to understand?                      |
| **Justification**   | Were decisions well-reasoned?                             |
| **WAF Alignment**   | Did they address reliability, security, cost, operations? |
| **Professionalism** | How would this land with a real customer?                 |
