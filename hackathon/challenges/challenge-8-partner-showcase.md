| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "Why did you choose [Service A] over [Service B]?"       | Can they justify technical decisions? |
| "How does this scale when we triple our order volume?"   | Did they think about peak season?     |
| "What happens if the primary region goes down?"          | Do they understand DR?                |
| "We might expand to Norway next year. How hard is that?" | Is the architecture extensible?       |

## Tips for Presenters (Partner Role)

✅ **DO:**

- Be confident — you built something real!
- Admit what you didn't finish (honesty wins respect)
- Explain trade-offs, not just decisions
- Use your artifacts (diagrams, Bicep, cost estimates)
- Thank the customer for their questions

❌ **DON'T:**

- Read from slides word-for-word
- Get defensive about questions
- Blame tools or time constraints
- Oversell features you didn't implement
- Go over time (the coach will cut you off!)

---

## Tips for Questioners (Customer Role)

✅ **DO:**

- Ask genuine questions (you might learn something!)
- Challenge assumptions respectfully
- Focus on business outcomes, not just tech
- Pick questions relevant to their presentation

❌ **DON'T:**

- Be hostile or try to "catch" them
- Ask questions just to show off
- Interrupt the presentation
- Ask about things clearly out of scope

---

| **Clarity**         | Was the solution easy to understand?                      |
