# Challenge 3: Bicep Implementation, Deployment & Workflow Understanding

> **Duration**: 70 minutes | **Agents**: `bicep-plan`, `bicep-code`, `deploy`
> **Output**: Deployed infrastructure + Workflow diagram

## The Business Challenge

Nordic Fresh Foods needs production-ready infrastructure code that:

- Can be deployed repeatedly and consistently
- Meets Azure governance and security requirements
- Is maintainable by their small DevOps team
- Follows infrastructure-as-code best practices

Your task: Generate Bicep templates, **deploy them to Azure**, and **demonstrate you understand
the agent workflow** by explaining it.

## Your Challenge

### Part A: Implementation Planning (15 min)

**Your Task**: Use the `bicep-plan` agent to create an implementation strategy.

**Guiding Questions**:

- What information does the agent need from your architecture assessment?
- How should you structure your prompt to get a phased implementation plan?
- What governance constraints might affect your deployment?

**Prompt Engineering Tip**: The agent works best when you provide context about your
architecture decisions, not just a file reference.

**Expected Output**: `agent-output/freshconnect/04-implementation-plan.md`

---

### Part B: Code Generation (25 min)

**Your Task**: Use the `bicep-code` agent to generate Infrastructure as Code.

**Consider**:

- How do you describe what you need to the agent?
- What module structure makes sense for this workload?
- How will you handle resource naming to avoid conflicts?

**The Agent Will Generate**:

```
infra/bicep/freshconnect/
├── main.bicep              # Orchestrator
├── main.bicepparam         # Parameters
├── deploy.ps1              # Deployment script
└── modules/                # Modular Bicep files
```

**Your Validation Steps**:

```bash
cd infra/bicep/freshconnect
bicep build main.bicep      # What does this check?
bicep lint main.bicep       # What does this validate?
```

**Questions to Explore**:

- What happens during `bicep build`? What errors would stop you?
- What does `bicep lint` check for? Are all warnings critical?
- How do Azure Policy constraints affect your deployment?

---

### Part C: Deployment (20 min) ⭐ REQUIRED

**Your Task**: Use the `deploy` agent to deploy your infrastructure to Azure.

**Before Deploying**:

```powershell
# Preview what will be created (What-If)
az deployment group what-if \
  --resource-group rg-freshconnect-dev-swc \
  --template-file main.bicep \
  --parameters main.bicepparam
```

**Deployment Questions**:

- Does the What-If output match your expectations?
- Are there any unexpected changes or deletions?
- Do you understand what each resource does?

**Deploy Your Infrastructure**:

Use the `deploy` agent or run:

```powershell
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group rg-freshconnect-dev-swc \
  --template-file main.bicep \
  --parameters main.bicepparam
```

**If Deployment Fails**:

- Read the error message carefully — what does it tell you?
- Is it a naming conflict? A policy violation? A missing parameter?
- How would you prompt the `bicep-code` agent to fix the issue?

---

### Part D: Understanding the Workflow (10 min) ⭐ REQUIRED

**Critical Deliverable**: Create a Mermaid flowchart that explains the agent-driven deployment workflow.

Your flowchart must show:

1. How the `bicep-code` agent generates templates
2. What happens during validation (`bicep build`)
3. What linting checks for (`bicep lint`)
4. How the `deploy` agent attempts deployment
5. Common errors and how agents adjust
6. The feedback loop when issues are discovered

**Why This Matters**: In your Partner Showcase, you'll need to explain this workflow to
demonstrate you understand the process, not just executed commands.

**Save your flowchart** in your presentation materials - you'll need it for Challenge 8.

**Example Structure** (expand this based on your experience):

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[bicep-code agent generates templates] --> B[Validation: bicep build]
    B --> C{Syntax Errors?}
    C -->|Yes| D[What types of errors?]
    C -->|No| E[Linting: bicep lint]
    E --> F[...]

    %% Complete this based on what you observe
```

## Key Concepts to Understand

### Resource Naming Patterns

**Question**: Why do some resources fail to deploy with "name already in use" errors?

**Explore**:

- How do you generate unique names for globally-unique resources?
- What's the pattern for Key Vault names? (Hint: 24 char limit)
- What's the pattern for Storage Account names? (Hint: special rules)

**Snippet for Discovery**:

```bicep
// Concept: Generate a unique suffix per resource group
var uniqueSuffix = uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)

// How would you use this for Key Vault? Storage? SQL?
```

### Required Tags

**Question**: Why do deployments fail with "RequestDisallowedByPolicy" errors about missing tags?

**Explore**:

- What tags are required by your subscription's Azure Policies?
- Where in your Bicep should tags be defined?
- How do you pass tags to modules?

### Security Baseline

**Question**: What security settings cause policy violations if missing?

**Research**:

- Storage accounts: What HTTPS/TLS settings are required?
- SQL: What authentication mode is enforced?
- App Services: What SSL/TLS requirements exist?

**Snippet for Exploration**:

```bicep
// What properties must be set to pass Azure Policy?
properties: {
  supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: ?
  minimumTlsVersion: ?
  allowBlobPublicAccess: ?
}
```

## Success Criteria

| Criterion                                  | Points |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Implementation plan created                | 5      |
| Bicep templates generated                  | 5      |
| Templates compile without errors           | 3      |
| **Infrastructure deployed successfully**   | 7      |
| **Workflow diagram created and explained** | 5      |
| **Total**                                  | **25** |

## Coaching Questions

When you encounter issues, ask yourself:

**Naming Conflicts**:

- Q: "My Key Vault deployment failed with 'name already exists'. What now?"
- Consider: How do globally-unique names work in Azure? What makes a good naming strategy?

**Policy Violations**:

- Q: "Why does my deployment fail with 'RequestDisallowedByPolicy'?"
- Consider: What does the error message tell you? How do you discover policy requirements?

**Agent Behavior**:

- Q: "The agent made changes I didn't expect. Why?"
- Consider: What context did you provide? What constraints does the agent know about?

**Validation vs Deployment**:

- Q: "My Bicep lints clean but deployment fails. Why?"
- Consider: What's the difference between syntax validation and runtime deployment?

## Next Step

After your infrastructure is deployed and you've created your workflow diagram:

Use any extra time to:

- Verify deployed resources in Azure Portal
- Explore alternative architectures
- Practice explaining your workflow diagram
- Prepare for the DR curveball
